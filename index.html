            <h2>Endometriosis awareness drive from Sheffield sufferer</h2>
            <p>A Sharrow woman, who has battled a silent disease for 12 years, held a fundraiser with a twist in a bid to raise awareness for her condition.</p>

            <p>Christie Mather, 24, has suffered from endometriosis since her teens, a long-term condition where tissue that normally grows inside the uterus are found elsewhere in the body. </p>


            <h3>The fundraiser</h3>
            <p>Ms Mather co-organised a silent auction, in which people wrote their bids next to the item they wanted, which she said was fitting due to the nature of the disease.</p>
            <p>She said: “I think the auction was a real success and I am already beginning plans for holding a similar event next year.”

The auction was held on Saturday at Old Sharrow Junior School and raised £600 to Endometriosis UK.</p>

            <p>Some of the prizes on offer included a comedy club ticket donated by The Leadmill,  Sheffield United FC match tickets, a two course meal and a cocktail masterclass at The Botanist. </p>

            <p>Mrs Mather has suffered with heavy periods since she was twelve, but first experienced chronic pain after the birth of her daughter in 2012.</p>

            <p>She had to quit her job as a barmaid at the Nailmakers Arms after being diagnosed in 2013, because the 8 hour shifts left her worn out and suffering with depression. </p>

            <p>Ms Mather, said: “I have been given a lot of conflicting information from medical professionals and no real answers.”</p>

            <p>“It is a constant battle to be heard by doctors and consultants in regards to endometriosis, it takes many women years to achieve a diagnosis as initial concerns are very easily brushed off. I still feel let down by the healthcare system and am constantly battling with GP’s for further treatment.”</p>

          <p>Ms Mather, said: “I was very lucky to stumble across the group, through them I have found answers to many of my questions and being able to talk to women with similar struggles to myself has been the most effective coping mechanism.”</p>

          <p>“Without the group I would not have achieved any of this and I would be in a very dark place right now. There is a lot to be done in awareness for this disease and mainly educating people on the impact it can have on sufferers’ lives.”</p>

<p>Mrs Mather is now back in work, but can still experience flair ups on her left hand side after physical activity.</p>
